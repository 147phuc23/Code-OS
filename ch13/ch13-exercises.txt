== Exercise 13-1 ==
** Question **
Using the time built-in command of the shell, try timing the operation
of the program in Listing 4-1 (copy.c) on your system.

** Answer **

(a) Experiment with different file and buffer sizes.  You can set the
buffer size using the -DBUF_SIZE=nbytes option when compiling the
program.

With different buffer sizes:

 - 10 bytes: 0.206 secs
 - 512 bytes: 0.013 secs
 - 512000 bytes: 0.007 secs

(b) Modify the open() system call to include the O_SYNC flag.  How
much difference does this make to the speed for various buffer sizes?

 - 10 bytes: 778.368 secs
 - 512 bytes: 14.408 secs
 - 512000 bytes: 0.042 secs 

(c) Try performing these timing tests on a range of file systems
(e.g. ext3, XFS, btrfs, and JFS).  Are the results similar?  Are the
trendsw the same when going from small to large buffer sizes?

  - Didn't try, in general the trend seems to hold for this kind of
    workload.  Readahead can be terrible in some cases (EEPROM).  Even
    broken sometimes.
